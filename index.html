                        <p>Nowadays, people are too busy to make home-cooked meals in their households, so we decided to create an application that gives the user the convenience and variety of culturally diverse home-cooked meals, made fresh right in the safety of their own home. ChefMeet is an application that allows busy individuals, families, and people who are throwing parties to connect with a personal chef to meet their needs. The project’s purpose was to diminish unhealthy options that people choose, instead of cooking home-cooked meals due to their busy lifestyle. We wanted to create a way for people to have an active, healthy option while having the food fresh and ready for the individual(s) when desired. </p>

                        <p>I was able to work on a redesign project for the Health and Human Services Government website. My goal was to re-create what would be the absolute and most user-friendly resource government site in the time frame of 4 weeks. The government agency of the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans. They do so by providing health and human services and sustaining advances in the sciences underlying medicine, public health, and social services.</p>
